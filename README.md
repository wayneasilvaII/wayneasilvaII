Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my growth from learning foundational programming concepts to designing, analyzing, and enhancing complete software systems. The capstone experience required me to revisit earlier work, evaluate it critically, and improve it using industry relevant tools, modern programming languages, and sound computer science principles. As a result, this portfolio represents both my technical abilities and my approach to professional problem solving.
Throughout the program, I developed strong skills in software design, data structures, and algorithmic thinking. I learned to select appropriate data structures, analyze trade-offs in efficiency and maintainability, and apply these decisions in real implementations. My coursework emphasized writing clear, modular code and improving existing systems rather than simply producing new ones. These skills are reflected in the enhanced artifacts that follow, which demonstrate structured refactoring, performance improvements, and thoughtful system design.
Equally important, the program strengthened my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly and work within collaborative and stakeholder-driven environments. Courses in systems analysis and design as well as software engineering reinforced the importance of requirements gathering, documentation, and adapting technical solutions to real-world constraints. I approach development with the mindset that code must be understandable, maintainable, and defensible,not just functional.
My experience also fostered a strong security and reliability mindset. Through working in multiple languages, including C++ and Rust, and integrating database-backed persistence, I gained a deeper appreciation for memory safety, error handling, and secure data management. I now prioritize correctness, predictability, and long-term stability in software design decisions.
The artifacts in this ePortfolio work together to illustrate my progression as a computer scientist and software engineer. Each demonstrates a different aspect of my skill set, while collectively they highlight my ability to design, evaluate, and improve software systems. This portfolio serves as both a summary of my academic journey and a foundation for my continued growth as a developer entering the field of computer science.
